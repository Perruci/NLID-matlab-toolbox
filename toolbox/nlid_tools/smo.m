function y=smo(x,numtimes)
% smooth with a 3-point, zero-phase,  moving average filter 
%
%	y(i) = x(i-1)/4 + x(i)/2 + x(i+1)/4
%
%	USAGE	: y = smo(x,numtimes)
%
%	x	: input vector
%	numtimes: number of times x should be smoothed
%
% if x is a matrix, smo(x,numtimes) will smooth each
% column of x numtimes
