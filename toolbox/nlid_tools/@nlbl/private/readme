Notes for HammerSLS.m

The main routine is in HammerSLS.m

the two other files, 
  poly_rescale.m
  lm_sls_parameters.m
should go somewhere that HammerSLS can see.  They will also be called
  by the SLS toolbox routines for Wiener and LNL systems (and parallel
  cascade reflex model, and...)

In addition, HammerSLS must be able to see the following nlid_toolbox
routines.
  multi_pwr.m
  multi_herm.m
  multi_tcheb.m

The routine still needs some work -- especially in finding suitable
stopping conditions.  An interface for manipulating the training 
parameters might be helpful.
