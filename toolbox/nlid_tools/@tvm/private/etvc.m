% The filter bounds can be specified using one of two methods, whichever is
% apropriate for the filter, H, being used:
%
% 1. Simple specify 'TYP' where 'TYP' equals 'one' to identify a one sided,
% and 'two' to identify a two sided filter.  The filter length is determined
% automatically from the column dimension of H.
%
% 2. Specify N1, and N2.  Where N1, and N2 are the filter bounds expressed in
% discrete time. To identify a filter which goes from -2 to 10, use
% N1 = -2, and N2 = 10.  This will yield a 13 point filter.  The filter
% bounds are restricted as follows:  N1 <= 0, and N2 > 0.  The filter
% length (=N2-N1+1) should agree with the column dimension of H.
