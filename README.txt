This archive contains the MATLAB nonlinear system identification
(NLID) toolbox.  The algorithms implemented in this toolbox are 
described in
  Westwick, DT and Kearney, RE, "Identification of Nonlinear
  Physiological Systems: Theory and Practice", IEEE Engineering in
  Medicine and Biology Book Series, IEEE Press/John Wiley & Sons,
  2003.  ISBN: 0471274569.

CONTENTS

The archive should contain 2 directories, "toolbox" and "references". 
"References" has two subdirectories:

nlid_book
	nlid_book/examples -- contains the code used to generate figures in
	Westwick and Kearney, 2003.

	nlid_book/problems -- contains solutions to all of the computer
	exercises in Westwick and Kearney, 2003.
  
nlid_docs
	contains a legacy manual and slides from a lecture that explain some functionality of the toolbox.

"Toolbox" has two subdirectories:
	
	nlid_tools -- contains the nlid toolbox routines.

	utility_tools -- contains some support routines for the nlid toolbox.

	
INSTALLATION

Run setup.m to add all required subdirectories to the MATLAB path. 
Depending on the branch of the repository being used, this script will also
allow the user to recompile the MEX-files needed for the toolbox.

Several of the more computationally intense routines are implemented 
as MEX files.  MEX files for Windows 32 bit, Linux and MAC OSX have 
been included in the archive's Master branch, and support for 
Windows 64 bit is included in the Win64 branch. Users of other 
operating systems will have to build these files themselves.

To build the MEX files, set up MATLAB to compile C/C++ MEX files.
Run the command install_nlid_mexfiles.m or setup.m. The mex files have been
built and verified using the GCC.  The behaviour of other complilers has not been
tested. 

	
LEGACY INSTALLATION

These instructions are preserved for users of the toolbox before it was updated to a Github repository.

Place the nlid_tools and utility_tools directories wherever MATLAB
toolboxes are stored on your system, and add both of them to your 
MATLAB search path. For example, if nlid_tools and utility_tools had
been placed in the directory /home/westwick/matlab/m_files, then
the commands:

path('/home/westwick/matlab/m_files/utility_tools',path);
path('/home/westwick/matlab/m_files/nlid_tools',path);

would add both these directories to the front of the search path (so
that they are searched before the rest of the path).  These commands 
may be added to your startup.m file, so that the NLID toolbox is
automatically enabled when MATLAB is started.

Several of the more computationally intense routines are implemented 
as MEX files.  MEX files for Windows 32 bit, Linux and MAC OSX have 
been included in the archive's Master branch, and support for 
Windows 64 bit is included in the Win64 branch. Users of other 
operating systems will have to build these files themselves.

To build the MEX files, set up MATLAB to compile C/C++ MEX files.
Start MATLAB, and add the nlid_tools and utility_tools to the search
path.  Run the command install_nlid_mexfiles.m  The mex files have been
built using the GCC.  The behaviour of other complilers has not been
tested.
